    <h1>Missing Facebook Patient Consent</h1>
<p>
Social media has facilitated an unprecedented level of communicating, consuming and creating health care information outside of hospitals, clinics, doctor’s offices and in-person support groups. Healthcare providers, patients and their families are using online support groups to foster patient engagement and facilitate patient education by sharing personal experiences, asking questions, and responding to requests for information, thus generating significant troves of patient data in the course of developing forums for knowledge discovery and discussion. Facebook support groups aid individuals and organizations in connecting, collaborating and accessing information in support of disease prevention, detection, treatment and care. Due to its mass adoption and ease of use, Facebook has become the dominant social media platform of choice for many online support groups to share private information about their health.
</p>

<p>
Facebook has misled patient communities. They have encouraged patients to use their platform to connect with other patients via Closed Groups, but they have refused to acknowledge and fix significant problems with the way the product works for patient privacy. What follows is a “missing informed consent document.”  If you are a patient connecting via Closed Groups, this is an explanation what Facebook <b>should</b> have told you when you started to use its platform to share your health data with other patients. 
</p>


<p>
There are four main ways that Facebook is different from other Social Media platforms, that you must understand in order to achieve “informed consent” to use Facebook patient communities.
</p>

<h2> First, you must use your real name on Facebook and that makes you vulnerable.   </h2>

<p>
Patients have used many different kinds of social media platforms to connect with each other and find help for their hardest healthcare problems. Generally, information that patients share on Social Media is open and available to the world. But on most social media platforms, there are mechanisms to share your private healthcare concerns without also sharing your identity. Twitter and Reddit, for instance, both have the concept of a “throw away account”.
</p>

<p>
It is critical to understand that Facebook does not work this way. Legitimate users of Facebook are required to use their real names, so there is no easy way to use Facebook without revealing information that will be tied back to your in-real-life identity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>What is the impact of using your real name?</b>  One example is that <a href='https://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates'>insurance companies</a> (both health and life) and <a href='https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/social-media-survey-2017'>employers</a> use this information to deny jobs and/or healthcare to you as a direct result of your participation in the Facebook groups. 
</p>

<h2> Your participation in healthcare communities on Facebook is public information. And you might be broadcasting your health conditions to the world as a result. </h2>

<p>
Patient communities on Facebook have to use the Groups product to connect with each other. It is not possible to participate in these groups without broadcasting the fact that you are a member of the group. That means that even if you are silent in a group, your membership in it is essentially public information. There are some small barriers to this information being fully available instantly to everyone, but basically, any person who is willing to be dishonest can download your participation in healthcare groups. 

</p>

<p>
This is especially problematic if you are in a group that is “only” for people who have a particular clinical condition. For instance, if you are in a group that is “only for Diabetics” then the fact that you are Diabetic is public information. If you are in an HIV support group, then the fact that you are HIV positive is public information. 
</p>

<p>
<b>What is the impact of this as you participate on Facebook?</b>  Your friends and family might not see your post in closed groups, because it is technically challenging to access the information.  Yet, that does not mean the information is not considered “Public” by Facebook and other people who might want to use this information against you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Can other people see that I am a member of these groups?</b> Yes, but it does take some effort to get this information. 
</p>

<h2>You can be forced to participate in healthcare communities without your knowledge.</h2>

<p>
It is possible to add any Facebook user into Facebook groups without or against their consent. That means that if your friend knows you are HIV positive, they might have added you to the HIV positive group without you knowing that. If you are Facebook user with a serious medical condition, you may have already been irrevocably outed by someone else (who probably did this un-intentionally, without understanding how these things work).
</p>

<p>
<b>What does this mean for you?</b> It means that even if you have decided not to use Facebook to share your healthcare information, this might still be a problem for you.
</p>


<h2>Despite all of this, Facebook allows Patient Support groups to promise privacy. </h2>

<p>
Facebook Groups is profoundly not private. However, there are healthcare support groups that are allowed to label themselves as “private” or even “anonymous”. Facebook’s documentation says one thing about its privacy settings, and almost all Closed Groups say something very different. Unfortunately, no matter what a Closed Group's introduction pages says about privacy, it is Facebooks technical decisions and policies that take precedence.
</p>

<p>
<b>What does this mean for you?</b> It is possible that you joined a Facebook patient group under the premise that your information was private. Facebook group administrators probably did not intend to deceive you, they were just relaying their own confused understanding of privacy settings. 
</p>

<h2>What you can do about this. </h2>

<ul>
	<li> <a href='https://www.callmycongress.com/'>Contact your congresspeople</a> and let them know about this page and that the FTC has already received a detailed complaint about these problems. </li>
	<li> Facebook often asks patients to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to discuss the security of their patient-facing products. Never sign these documents, which gives Facebook the right to sue you if you discuss the failings of Facebook’s product, and gives you absolutely nothing. </l>
	<li> You can choose to leave Facebook entirely. Given Facebook’s history of duplicity with regards to privacy, this is the only fully safe option. If you choose to do this, <a href='https://circleoftrust.typeform.com/to/ytNPIr'>please drop us a note as you leave.</a> We will get back in touch with you, if the situation ever improves.</li>
	<li> You can choose to leave all healthcare related groups on Facebook.  </li>

</ul>
